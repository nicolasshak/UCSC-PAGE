What drew so many Jews across so many diverse contexts to focus on radical leftist politics? What, if anything, links Jews and radical politics across such diverse contexts? Through primary sources, memoirs, scholarly works, films and more, students compare Jewish engagement in radical leftist movements in several nodes, including Russia (and the former USSR), Poland, France, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Israel, Argentina, Mexico, and the USA among others.",
